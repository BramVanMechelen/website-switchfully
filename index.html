          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>Hi there, welcome to my first webpage! This page is about something quite special and unique: Me! I grew up in a little township, part of a little village, which in itself was part of a small town. Just like every country boy, I wanted to move to the big city when I grew up. I was also fascinated by history. I wasn't the best student, <em>don't know much about the French I took</em>, but cool facts and dates always stuck. Quite a lot has changed since then: I moved from the small township to the city, I got myself a history degree and soon I will start a new career path: as a software developer! - To be continued... <p>

            <h3>Student</h3>
            <p>After high school I started studying at the university of Antwerp. I chose Antwerp because it was close by and they focused more on modern history than Ghent or Leuven. I really enjoyed studying history and met a lot of great and interesting people. During my studies I was also part of the organization of the history student club. In my final year I wrote my thesis on the repatriation of dead bodies to their home country; specifically about the Dutch soldiers who died in Antwerp during the Belgian Revolution.</p>
